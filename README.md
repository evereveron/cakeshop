# Cakeshop

An integrated development environment and SDK for Ethereum-like ledgers

![screenshot](docs/images/screenshot.png "screenshot")

## What is it?

_Cakeshop_ is a set of tools and APIs for working with [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/)-like ledgers, packaged as a Java web application archive (WAR) that gets you up and running in under 60 seconds.

Included in the package is the [geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)
Ethereum server, a [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
compiler and all dependencies.

It provides tools for managing a local blockchain node, setting up clusters,
exploring the state of the chain, and working with contracts.

## Quickstart

### Requirements

* Java 7+
* Java app server (Tomcat, Jetty, etc) [Optional]

### Running via Spring Boot

* Download WAR file
* Run `java -jar cakeshop.war`
* Navigate to [http://localhost:8080/cakeshop/](http://localhost:8080/cakeshop/)

### Running via App Server

* Download WAR file
* Put in `/webapps` folder of your app server
* Add Java system property `-Dspring.profiles.active=local` to startup script (`setenv.sh` for tomcat)
* Start app server
* Navigate to [http://localhost:8080/cakeshop/](http://localhost:8080/cakeshop/) (default port is usually 8080)

### Running via Docker

```
docker run -it cakeshop
```

Running under a specific environment
```
docker run -it -e JAVA_OPTS="-Dspring.profiles.active=local" cakeshop
```

### Running with Quorum

(requires [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html))

```
git clone https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-examples.git
cd quorum-examples
vagrant up
vagrant ssh

(in vagrant shell)
vagrant$ cd quorum-examples/7nodes
vagrant$ ./init.sh && ./start.sh

(in host shell)
java -jar cakeshop.war example
java -jar cakeshop.war
```

At this point you should have Cakeshop running and connected to node 1 in the Quorum cluster (dd1 on RPC port 22000).

You can change the node you're connected to by running the last two commands again from another directory and modifying the properties file at `data/local/application.properties` to point to a different RPC port in the range `22000-22006` before starting Cakeshop.
